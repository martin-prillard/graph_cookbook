One of the bots ( Atom )* did not generate traffic because\n","it detects virtual machines. Each bot was deployed in a Windows XP virtual machine that ran for\n","several days. The virtual environment was fully monitored from DNS server to the router. We\n","configured and deployed an authoritative DNS server (in the lab) **ns1.botnet.isot**. with IP\n","**192.168.50.88**. We configured each bot to specifically communicate with a command and\n","control (C&C) server that we setup. For example, for the Zeus botnet, we setup a C&C server\n","named zeus.botnet.isot.\n","\n","List of botnets and their VMs, where the following naming convention is used\n","{**Exploit_kit_name**}.botnet.isot:\n","```\n","192.168.50.14 zyklon.botnet.isot\n","192.168.50.15 blue.botnet.isot\n","192.168.50.16 liphyra.botnet.isot\n","192.168.50.17 gaudox.botnet.isot gdox.botnet.isot dox.botnet.isot **\n","192.168.50.18 blackout.botnet.isot\n","192.168.50.30 citadel.botnet.isot ***\n","192.168.50.31 citadel.botnet.isot ***\n","192.168.50.32 be.botnet.isot black energy\n","192.168.50.34 zeus.botnet.isot\n","```\n","\n","**Notes:**\n","\n","\\* We have also deployed ATOM exploit kit, which is the third generation of Zeus, but we did not\n","see any traffic going as we expected that it detects that it is running under a virtual machine.\n","\n","** dox, gdox, gaudox, all are refereeing to the same exploit kit “Gaudox”.

This allowed us to passively classify DNS traffic and\n","differentiate malicious traffic vs. normal traffic. The data was collected in a virtual environment. Each individual software application was installed on a virtual machine that\n","was running windows 7. The DNS resolver of each machine was pointed to our DNS server\n","**192.168.50.88**.
