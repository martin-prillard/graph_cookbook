    "- **Community Detection**: Finding groups of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network\n",
    "- **Node Embedding**: Converting graph nodes into vector representations that capture structural relationships\n",
    "- **Clustering Algorithms**: Grouping nodes based on their embeddings or structural properties\n",
    "- **Dimension Reduction**: Visualizing high-dimensional embeddings in 2D space\n",
